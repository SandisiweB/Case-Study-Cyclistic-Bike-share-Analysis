# A Case-Study-Cyclistic-Bike-share-Analysis

## Introduction and Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

# Ask Phase
## Business Task Statement
Cyclists are a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. It consists of two broad consumer segments; Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing believes the future success of Cyclistic depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Moreno, the director of marketing, has set a clear goal to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Therefore I have been tasked to dive deep into Cyclistic historical bike trip data and analyze the dataset to identify trends and patterns between the two customer segments. The analysis should provide clarity and answer the following business question:  
how do annual members and casual riders differ? 
why would casual riders buy a membership? and 
how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

**Shareholders:**

**Primary shareholders:** 
Lily Moreno, The director of marketing and your manager. 
Cyclistic executive team: The detail-oriented executive team that will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

**Secondary shareholders:**
Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. 

The key business question:
Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

To answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act


# Prepare Phase
## Data Source Description
I used Cyclistic’s historical trip data (from the previous operating year, 2022) to analyze and identify trends.
The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. Where the grants of a non-exclusive, royalty-free, limited, perpetual license are given to access, reproduce, analyze, copy, modify, distribute in our product or service, and use the Data for any lawful purpose. It also lists out the terms and conditions that we adhere to which ensure the privacy and security of the riders’ personally identifiable information and the usage of the data. This means that the analysis won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes. 

The data consists of 12 CSV files for each month with 13 columns and more than 5 million rows.

ROCCC approach is used to explore the credibility of the data source.

**Reliable**: the data is complete and valid for conducting the Cyclitic bike-sharing analysis.

**Original**: The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc, which operates the city of Chicago’s Divvy bicycle-sharing service. The system is owned by the Chicago Department of Transportation and has been operated by Lyft since 2019.

**Comprehensive**: the data has all the critical information needed to answer the key business task.


**Current**: the data is dated 20222, the intended year of study. 

**Cited**: the data is cited and made available under Data Licence Agreement.



# Process Phase
A strong analysis depends on the integrity of the data. The following steps were done to ensure the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of the data before conducting the analysis.

## Recommendations
**1. Offer Incentives for Conversion**
Offer incentives for conversion such as a discount or free trial on the first month of subscription.

**2. Membership Package**
Tailor membership packages that satisfy casual riders' usage preferences and patterns.

This could include the benefits of: 

-Priority access to bikes during peak hours or priority access to bikes in the most popular stations.

-Access special discounts at their selected stations during spring and summer.

-Partner with local stores to offer access to exclusives or discounts. It may be local stores that sell bike merchandise and items of clothing.


**3. Integrate the mobile app**

The app may include features such as:

-Dedicated customer support

-Personalized recommendations for popular routes,
Showcasing the widely available docking stations and availability of bikes in various locations, and

-Receives notification of the  discounts and other benefits of the seasons. 

The app will not only enhance the user experience but also proactively engage with casual riders to understand their needs, preferences, and concerns 


**THE END!**
